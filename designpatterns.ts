/*
Name the three main groups of design patterns and declare some of their most commonly used or most known patterns:
    - Name them
    - Be able to explain them
    - Implement them

This excercise is assigned by myself, to myself, to revise my knowledge of design patterns. After 3 years of experience I find that any developer sometimes benefits from looking back at the basics. Wether its to think back on patterns we didnt used to use, or ones we do not favor anymore AND WHY?.
In the context of looking for a new job this helps me to take a step back from coding from experience and towards being able to explain myself clearly in theory in front of a live audience or panel.
If you are a technical recruiter, architect or anyone looking to hire me: Know that these are implemented in a simple way, the same way you would explain them to a junior. If you are interested to see me use them in practice, feel free to give me a refactor excercise.
